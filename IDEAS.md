# Ideas, Thoughts, and Future Plans

## Misc
- Script playlist additions to keep uploaded but unreleased vids out of the playlist
- 2nd channel to try out things like API access?
- Better mic (pop filter?)

## makeThumbnail.ps1
- Description created from standard bits and pieces (sorta like mail merge for video descriptions)
- store api keys / env vars (Azure Key Vault? Session vars?) and use the YouTube API to automate uploads, set scheduling

## OBS
- Get a better handle on scenes, ex. fade to 10-20s of outro for YT end screen. Should be short. Enough time to say thanks for watching. Hate lengthy outros.

## Resolve
- Backup strategies? Probably not going to use this tool much, but a cursory glance at options is probably a good idea.
