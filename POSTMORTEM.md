# Episode Post Mortems
Quick review of episodes to identify improvements, things to repeat, etc. Items to work on will promote to IDEAS.md.

## DTT Automate Channel Tasks

#### Removed/Cancelled/Completed/Promoted
- ~~Remeber to add ~20s for youtube end screen
  
## DTT Play Mini Motorways
- Ad-hoc post-mortem is ok here, but telling a story would also be nice.
#### Removed/Cancelled/Completed/Promoted
- ~~Audio too low
- ~~Hit hotkey to stop recording instead of show end screen. Maybe need to separate hotkeys these better.
  
## DTT Play Project Zomboid
- Switch between 1st and 3rd person
    - Maybe some written story beats to help w/ tense switching?
- I like “when we last left” in future eps. Sounds like old tv.
- Need to balance telling a story w/ paying attention to the game. Ended a run while talking. Still, made for a nice jump scare.

- Double-back for items at your peril
- Get outta town proper asap, until you get better at it.
- Checked map, it's massive. Would be nice to explore other areas of Muldraugh.
#### Removed/Cancelled/Completed/Promoted
- ~~Audio too low
- ~~Better mic. Can hear breathing. Might be ok for isolated, tense games, but not so much for things like Mini Motortways.~~
- ~~Post-episode "epilogue" card for end of recording. 20-30s max. Resolve?
- ~~Press "Play" not "random" when creating a character, lol
  
## All episodes recorded prior to 23SEP
- ~~Audio is too low. OBS desktop at -1.3dB sounds ok
- ~~Existing mic is terrible
- ~~OBS Scene to add 10s "end screen" looks like an ok setup for recording
- ~~Should record a bunch of eps, release all the bad audio eps + one fixed ep, then resume scheduled releases for fixed+1 (dropped all un-rerleased bad audio eps instead)
