# Episode Post Mortems
Quick review of each episode to identify improvements, things to repeat, etc. Items to work on will promote to IDEAS.md.

## DTT Play Project Zomboid 01
- Audio too low
- ~~Better mic. Can hear breathing. Might be ok for isolated, tense games, but not so much for things like Mini Motortways.~~
- Post-episode "epilogue" card for  end of recording. 20-30s max. Resolve?
- Switch between 1st and 3rd person
    - Maybe some written story beats to help w/ tense switching?
- I like “when we last left” in future eps. Sounds like old tv.

## DTT Play Project Zomboid 02
- No changes from [01](#dtt-play-project-zomboid-01)

## DTT Automate Channel Tasks 01
- Remeber to add ~20s for youtube end screen
